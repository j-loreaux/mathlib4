# Failure modes of `cfc_pull`

Every way `cfc_pull` and its attribute can fail, pinned down with `#guard_msgs`. This is partly
regression testing and partly documentation: these messages are what a user sees when something
goes wrong, so it is worth keeping them legible.

/--
error: `cfc_pull` could not find an application of `cfc` or `cfcₙ` in the goal from
which to read off the scalar ring and the element; supply them explicitly, as in
`cfc_pull ℝ a`

/--
error: `cfc_pull`'s first argument is the scalar ring, but `a` did not elaborate as a type:
  type expected, got
    (a : A)
If `a` is the element to pull towards, give the scalar ring too — or `_`, as in `cfc_pull _ a`.
-/

/- Which is exactly what `_` is for: the element alone, with the ring read off the goal. -/

/--
error: `cfc_pull` made no progress
  `cfc_pull` reached its maximum recursion depth of 1; either
  the expression is more deeply nested than that, or the `@[cfc_pull]` lemma set is
  looping. Raise the limit with `cfc_pull (maxDepth := 2) ..`
-/
#guard_msgs in
example (ha : IsStarNormal a) : star a * a = star a * a := by
  cfc_pull (maxDepth := 1) ℂ a

/- Not every failure is a failure to rewrite. Reaching `ℝ≥0` from `ℝ` is a scalar conversion
with a side condition of its own — `cfc_real_eq_nnreal` asks for `0 ≤ a` — so a pull towards
`ℝ≥0` of an element that is only known to be selfadjoint gets all the way there and then fails
on the condition. -/
/--
error: `cfc_pull` rewrote the goal but could not discharge 1 side goal:

  inst✝¹ : PartialOrder A
  inst✝ : StarOrderedRing A

  ha : IsSelfAdjoint a

Use `cfc_pull +defer ..` to have them added to the goal list instead.

/- Side goals that neither `assumption` nor the auto-param tactics can close are an error unless
`+defer` is given. -/

  cfc_pull ℂ a

/- `+defer` does not help inside `conv`, which cannot end with unsolved goals — the same
restriction that `rw` inside `conv` is subject to. A `=> tac` block is what closes them there;
see the `ConvSideGoals` section of `Examples.lean`. -/

/- `+deferAll` makes `conv` strictly worse *on its own*: it hands back the side goals that the
discharging would have closed, so a `conv` pull that succeeds without it fails with it. It is
useful there only together with a `=> tac` block, which is then handed the whole list. -/

the side goals of a pull that succeeded. -/

-/
#guard_msgs in
example (ha : IsStarNormal a) : star b * b = star b * b := by
  cfc_pull +deferAll ℂ a

/- A `=> tac` block that does not close everything it was handed is an error naming what is
left, rather than the bare `conv` complaint the same goal would have produced without a block.
Note also what reaches the block: `hf` settles `f`'s continuity during the discharging, so only
`g`'s is left for it — the block implies `+defer`, not `+deferAll`. -/
/--
error: `cfc_pull` ran the `=> ..` block, but 1 side goal is still open:

  inst✝ : StarOrderedRing A
  a b : A
  ha : IsStarNormal a
  f g : ℂ → ℂ
  hf : ContinuousOn f (spectrum ℂ a)
  ⊢ ContinuousOn g (spectrum ℂ a)
A `conv` block cannot end with unsolved goals, so the `=> ..` block must close every one.

  conv_lhs => arg 1; cfc_pull ℂ a => skip

/- A local definition is an atom by default, so the pull stops at one. The head symbol is `_`,
as it is for any free variable, so the message names `+zetaDelta` rather than leaving the user
with nothing to go on. -/
/--
error: `cfc_pull` made no progress
  `cfc_pull` got stuck on `d`
    (head symbol: _, target: cfc over ℂ at `a`)
  `d` is a local definition, and `cfc_pull` does not look
  at what it stands for. Unfold it with `cfc_pull +zetaDelta ..`, or rewrite it away
  first — `set .. with h` hands you the equation `h` to do it with.

  trivial

/- The block is handed the side goals and nothing else, so on a pull that left none it has no
goal to work on. `all_goals ..` is the way to write a block that tolerates an empty list. -/

/-! #### The lemma list -/

/- `-foo` is only meaningful for a lemma that is in the set to begin with; a name that is not
there is much more likely to be a typo than a no-op the user wanted. -/
/--
error: `Nat.add_comm` is not in the `cfc_pull` lemma set, so `-Nat.add_comm` has nothing to remove
-/
#guard_msgs in

  cfc_pull [-Nat.add_comm] ℂ a

/- A lemma added at the call site is classified exactly as `@[cfc_pull]` would classify it, and
is rejected here for the same reasons and with the same message, reported at the name. -/
/--
error: @[cfc_pull] failed: neither side of `Nat.add_comm` has `cfc` or `cfcₙ`
as its head symbol:
  ?n + ?m = ?m + ?n
-/
#guard_msgs in
example (ha : IsStarNormal a) : star a = cfc (fun x : ℂ ↦ star x) a := by
  cfc_pull [Nat.add_comm] ℂ a

/- Only declaration names may be listed. A local hypothesis is what `simp` would take here, so
the message says why this is not `simp`. -/
/--
error: `hf` is a local hypothesis, and `cfc_pull`'s lemma list takes declaration names only: a
  `@[cfc_pull]` lemma is instantiated from its constant, so there is nothing for a hypothesis to
  be. Rewrite with it first, as in `rw [hf]`.

section RingAndElement

/- `cfc_comp_re` and its three siblings change the scalar ring *and* the element. The `Scalar`
category cannot express that — `convert` applies a scalar lemma expecting the element to survive
— and the `Compose` category cannot either, since it is indexed at a single ring. So they are
rejected rather than silently entered as a bogus `ℂ → ℝ` conversion edge. -/

/--
error: @[cfc_pull] failed: `cfc_comp_re` changes both the scalar ring and the
element of the functional calculus; such lemmas are not supported. A scalar

ring alone.

section UndeterminedVariable

/- A tagged lemma is rejected at *use* time, not at tagging time, when its statement leaves one of
its variables undetermined. `cfc_map_prod`'s auxiliary scalar ring `S` occurs only in its
hypotheses and instance arguments, so the lemma enters the database but can never be applied;
this is why it and `cfcₙ_map_prod` are left untagged in Mathlib. `set_option
trace.Tactic.cfc_pull true` reports the reason: the instance argument `CommRing ?S` is not
determined. -/

section BoundHoles

/--
warning: `cfc_sum` applies the functional calculus at
  cfc (?f #0) ?a
which mentions a bound variable. `cfc_pull` cannot recurse under a binder, so it will
treat that position as part of the pattern rather than as a hole: the lemma will only
apply when the position is already an application of the calculus.

If that is what you intend, silence this warning with
`set_option cfcPull.warnBoundHoles false in`.
