# Examples for the `cfc_pull` tactic

This is the main test suite for `cfc_pull`. Each example states an identity between an
expression in a C⋆-algebra (or in any algebra with a continuous functional calculus) and the same
expression with `cfc`/`cfcₙ` pulled to the head, and proves it with `cfc_pull`.

`cfc_pull` replaces the goal by an equality of two `cfc` applications — closed by `rfl` when the
two functions agree — and discharges the hypotheses of the lemmas it used with `assumption` and
the standard auto-param tactics `cfc_tac`, `cfc_cont_tac` and `cfc_zero_tac`. Anything it cannot
close is an error unless `+defer` is given, in which case it becomes a goal named after its kind
(`cfc_pull.continuity`, `cfc_pull.predicate`, `cfc_pull.mapZero`, `cfc_pull.side`). `+deferAll`
skips the discharging altogether and hands back every side goal, deduplicated. In `conv` mode,
where a leftover goal cannot escape the block, a trailing `=> tac` block closes them in place.

Examples that `cfc_pull` deliberately does *not* finish are marked as such; in every case what is
left over is either an honest side condition or an equality of functions that has to be settled
with `cfc_congr`.
-/

/- The predicate hypotheses below are used by `cfc_pull` itself (it tries `assumption` on the
side goals it raises), which the unused-variable linter cannot see. -/

section GenericUnital

/- The user supplies the scalar ring `R` and the element `a`; the unital calculus is used because
the algebra has one. -/

variable {R A : Type*} {p : A → Prop} [CommSemiring R]
  [StarRing R] [MetricSpace R] [IsTopologicalSemiring R] [ContinuousStar R] [Ring A]
  [StarRing A] [TopologicalSpace A] [Algebra R A] [ContinuousFunctionalCalculus R A p]
  [ContinuousMap.UniqueHom R A] {a : A} {f g : R → R}

example (ha : p a) :
    star a * a = cfc (fun x : R ↦ star x * x) a := by
  cfc_pull R a

/- Note that `+defer` would make no difference here: it does not switch the discharging off, it
only changes what happens to the goals the discharging could not close, and here there are none.
See the `MessySideGoals` section below for where it does matter. -/

example (ha : p a) (hf : ContinuousOn f (spectrum R a)) (hg : ContinuousOn g (spectrum R a)) :
    star (cfc f a) + cfc g a + a = cfc (fun x ↦ star (f x) + g x + x) a := by
  cfc_pull R a

example (ha : p a) :
    a ^ 2 + 3 • a * cfc (id : R → R) a = cfc (fun x : R ↦ x ^ 2 + 3 • x * x) a := by
  cfc_pull R a

/- Composition: the calculus is applied to `a ^ 2` rather than to `a`, which `cfc_comp_pow`
resolves in one step. -/
example (ha : p a) (hf : ContinuousOn f ((· ^ 2) '' spectrum R a)) :
    cfc f (a ^ 2) = cfc (fun x ↦ f (x ^ 2)) a := by
  cfc_pull R a

/- A double composition: `cfc_comp_pow` peels off the power, and `cfc_comp'` the inner `cfc`. -/
example (ha : p a) (hf : Continuous f) (hg : ContinuousOn g (spectrum R a)) :
    cfc f ((cfc g a) ^ 2) = cfc (fun x ↦ f (g x ^ 2)) a := by
  cfc_pull R a

/- `cfc_pull` also works in `conv` mode, which is how one pulls at a specific position. -/
example (ha : p a) (b : A) :
    star a * a + b = cfc (fun x : R ↦ star x * x) a + b := by
  conv in star a * a => cfc_pull R a

/- `cfc_pull` does not go under binders; `conv` does. Pull each summand under the binder first,
and then let `cfc_sum` collect the result. -/
example {ι : Type*} {s : Finset ι} {h : ι → R → R}
    (hh : ∀ i, ContinuousOn (h i) (spectrum R a)) :
    ∑ i ∈ s, star (cfc (h i) a) = cfc (∑ i ∈ s, fun x ↦ star (h i x)) a := by
  conv_lhs => enter [2, i]; cfc_pull R a
  cfc_pull +defer R a
  case cfc_pull.side => exact fun i _ ↦ (hh i).star

/- The same goal, discharged in place instead of deferred. `(disch := tac)` runs `tac` on the
`cfc_pull.side` goals, and only on those: the hypotheses peculiar to an individual lemma, here
the continuity hypothesis of `cfc_sum`, which is stated under a binder and so is out of
`cfc_cont_tac`'s reach. -/
example {ι : Type*} {s : Finset ι} {h : ι → R → R}
    (hh : ∀ i, ContinuousOn (h i) (spectrum R a)) :
    ∑ i ∈ s, star (cfc (h i) a) = cfc (∑ i ∈ s, fun x ↦ star (h i x)) a := by
  conv_lhs => enter [2, i]; cfc_pull R a
  cfc_pull (disch := intro i _; fun_prop) R a

/- Note that `cfc_pull` produces `f (x * x)`, not `f (x ^ 2)`: it follows the shape of the term
it is given, and there is no `cfcₙ_pow` to turn `a * a` into a square. -/

  cfc_pull ℝ≥0 (star a * a)

/- `a ^ (x : ℝ)`, pulled over `ℝ≥0`. `CFC.rpow_def` is definitional, so there is nothing to
discharge here; the product below does need continuity, which `fun_prop` gets from `0 ≤ x`. -/

section MessySideGoals

/-! ## Side goals the auto-param tactics cannot close

`cfc_tac`, `cfc_cont_tac` and `cfc_zero_tac` between them handle continuity of everything
`fun_prop` knows and the routine predicate goals. Plenty of side goals are outside that reach:
continuity on a set that has to be located first, or a hypothesis about the values a function
takes on the spectrum. Those are an error by default, and `+defer` hands them back — named, so
that `case cfc_pull.continuity => ..` picks them out. `cfc_pull` has already done the structural
half of the work. -/

variable {A : Type*} [CStarAlgebra A] [PartialOrder A] [StarOrderedRing A]
variable {a : A}

open scoped NNReal

/- `Real.log` is not continuous at `0`, so `cfc_mul` leaves a continuity goal that `fun_prop`
cannot discharge. It follows from `IsStrictlyPositive a`, but only after unfolding that to
`IsUnit a` and going through `spectrum.zero_notMem`. Note that the goal appears once, not twice,
even though `cfc_mul` asks for it on both factors: identical side goals are merged. -/
example (ha : IsStrictlyPositive a) :
    CFC.log a * CFC.log a = cfc (fun x : ℝ ↦ Real.log x * Real.log x) a := by
  cfc_pull +defer ℝ a
  case cfc_pull.continuity => exact Real.continuousOn_log.mono fun x hx h ↦ spectrum.zero_notMem ℝ ha.2 (h ▸ hx)

/- The same story one ring down: `(· ^ x)` on `ℝ≥0` is continuous away from `0` when `x < 0`. -/
example (ha : IsStrictlyPositive a) (x : ℝ) :
    a ^ x * a ^ x = cfc (fun t : ℝ≥0 ↦ t ^ x * t ^ x) a := by
  cfc_pull +defer ℝ≥0 a
  case cfc_pull.continuity => exact NNReal.continuousOn_rpow_const (.inl (spectrum.zero_notMem ℝ≥0 ha.2))

/- Not every side goal is a continuity goal: `cfc_inv` needs the function to be nonvanishing on
the spectrum, which here takes a hypothesis about the spectrum's location. -/
example (ha : IsSelfAdjoint a) (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : Continuous f)
    (hspec : spectrum ℝ a ⊆ Set.Icc (-1) 1) (hf0 : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1, f x ≠ 0) :
    Ring.inverse (cfc f a) = cfc (fun x : ℝ ↦ (f x)⁻¹) a := by
  cfc_pull +deferAll ℝ a
  case cfc_pull.side => exact fun x hx ↦ hf0 x (hspec hx)
  case cfc_pull.predicate => exact ha
  case cfc_pull.continuity => fun_prop

end MessySideGoals

section DeferAll

/-! ## `+deferAll`: every side goal, discharged by hand

`+defer` returns only the goals the discharging could not close, so what comes back depends on
how far `fun_prop` and `cfc_tac` happened to get. `+deferAll` switches the discharging off
instead — no `assumption`, no auto-param tactic, no `(disch := ..)` — so the goal list is exactly
the hypotheses of the lemmas the pull used. Deduplication still runs first, and that is what
makes `cfc_pull +deferAll .. <;> tac` a sensible thing to write. -/

variable {R A : Type*} {p : A → Prop} [CommSemiring R]
  [StarRing R] [MetricSpace R] [IsTopologicalSemiring R] [ContinuousStar R] [Ring A]
  [StarRing A] [TopologicalSpace A] [Algebra R A] [ContinuousFunctionalCalculus R A p]
  [ContinuousMap.UniqueHom R A] {a : A}

/- Plain `cfc_pull R a` closes this outright (it is the first example in the file). With
`+deferAll` the three hypotheses it would have used come back instead: the shared predicate
goal `p a`, asked for by `cfc_star_id` and by `cfc_id'`, and the two continuity hypotheses of
`cfc_mul`. -/
example (ha : p a) : star a * a = cfc (fun x : R ↦ star x * x) a := by
  cfc_pull +deferAll R a <;> first | assumption | fun_prop

/- The goals are named after their kind, exactly as with `+defer`. -/
example (ha : p a) : star a * a = cfc (fun x : R ↦ star x * x) a := by
  cfc_pull +deferAll R a
  case cfc_pull.predicate => exact ha
  all_goals fun_prop

end DeferAll

section DeferAllCStar

variable {A : Type*} [CStarAlgebra A] [PartialOrder A] [StarOrderedRing A]
variable {a : A}

/- Deduplication is what keeps the list short: `cfc_mul` asks for the continuity of `Real.log`
once per factor, and one goal comes back, not two. Compare the `+defer` version of this example
in `MessySideGoals` above — there the deduplication is invisible, because the auto-param tactic
had already failed on both copies. -/
example (ha : IsStrictlyPositive a) :
    CFC.log a * CFC.log a = cfc (fun x : ℝ ↦ Real.log x * Real.log x) a := by
  cfc_pull +deferAll ℝ a
  exact Real.continuousOn_log.mono fun x hx h ↦ spectrum.zero_notMem ℝ ha.2 (h ▸ hx)

/- `(disch := ..)` is inert under `+deferAll`: nothing at all is run on a side goal, the
discharger included. This is the `cfc_pull.side` example from `MessySideGoals` above, where the
discharger does close the goal when `+deferAll` is absent; here the same discharger is given and
the goal still comes back, so the `case cfc_pull.side` below is what proves it. -/
example (ha : IsSelfAdjoint a) (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : Continuous f)
    (hspec : spectrum ℝ a ⊆ Set.Icc (-1) 1) (hf0 : ∀ x ∈ Set.Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1, f x ≠ 0) :
    Ring.inverse (cfc f a) = cfc (fun x : ℝ ↦ (f x)⁻¹) a := by
  cfc_pull +deferAll (disch := exact fun x hx ↦ hf0 x (hspec hx)) ℝ a
  case cfc_pull.side => exact fun x hx ↦ hf0 x (hspec hx)
  case cfc_pull.predicate => exact ha
  case cfc_pull.continuity => fun_prop

end DeferAllCStar

section ConvSideGoals

/-! ## `=> tac`: side goals inside a `conv` block

A `conv` block cannot end with unsolved goals, so in `conv` mode a side goal that survives the
discharging is fatal, and `+defer`/`+deferAll` — which only move goals onto the goal list — are
no help at all. The `=> tac` block is the way out, and is to `conv` mode what the tactic
following `cfc_pull +defer ..` is to tactic mode: the surviving side goals become its goal list,
the `conv` goal is set aside so the block cannot touch it, and the block has to close all of
them. Writing the block implies `+defer`. -/

variable {A : Type*} [CStarAlgebra A] [PartialOrder A] [StarOrderedRing A]
variable {a : A}

/- The motivating case. `Real.log` is continuous only away from `0`, so `cfc_cont_tac` cannot
close the continuity goal, and without the block this `conv` cannot be closed at all. -/
example (ha : IsStrictlyPositive a) (b : A) :
    CFC.log a * CFC.log a + b = cfc (fun x : ℝ ↦ Real.log x * Real.log x) a + b := by
  conv in CFC.log a * CFC.log a =>
    cfc_pull ℝ a =>
      exact Real.continuousOn_log.mono fun x hx h ↦ spectrum.zero_notMem ℝ ha.2 (h ▸ hx)

/- The goals keep their kind tags inside the block, so `case` addresses a group here exactly as
it does in tactic mode. -/
example (ha : IsStrictlyPositive a) (b : A) :
    CFC.log a * CFC.log a + b = cfc (fun x : ℝ ↦ Real.log x * Real.log x) a + b := by
  conv in CFC.log a * CFC.log a =>
    cfc_pull ℝ a =>
      case cfc_pull.continuity =>
        exact Real.continuousOn_log.mono fun x hx h ↦ spectrum.zero_notMem ℝ ha.2 (h ▸ hx)

/- `+deferAll .. => all_goals tac` is the `conv`-mode counterpart of the tactic-mode idiom
`cfc_pull +deferAll .. <;> tac`: the block faces the hypotheses of the lemmas the pull used,
rather than whatever the auto-param tactics happened to leave. This pull needs no block at all
without `+deferAll` — the discharging closes all three goals — which is what makes it the honest
illustration of what the flag hands over. -/
example (ha : IsStarNormal a) (b : A) :
    star a * a + b = cfc (fun x : ℂ ↦ star x * x) a + b := by
  conv in star a * a =>
    cfc_pull +deferAll ℂ a =>
      case cfc_pull.predicate => exact ha
      all_goals fun_prop

/- The block is a tactic sequence and so is delimited by indentation: the `conv` step after it
belongs to the enclosing `conv` block and is not swallowed. Unlike `equals`, the block does not
have to come last. -/
example (ha : IsStrictlyPositive a) (b : A) :
    CFC.log a * CFC.log a + b = cfc (fun x : ℝ ↦ Real.log x * Real.log x) a + b := by
  conv_lhs =>
    enter [1]
    cfc_pull ℝ a =>
      exact Real.continuousOn_log.mono fun x hx h ↦ spectrum.zero_notMem ℝ ha.2 (h ▸ hx)
    rfl

end ConvSideGoals

section LetBound

/-! ## `let`-bound variables and `+zetaDelta`

A local definition is an atom: `cfc_pull` does not look at what it stands for. The default is
`false` for the reason `simp` chose the same one — `set b := e with hb` is a request to stop
reading `e`, and unfolding it silently would undo the abstraction and strand `hb`. -/

variable {A : Type*} [CStarAlgebra A] {a : A}

/- With `+zetaDelta` the definition is unfolded and the pull proceeds on its structure. -/
example (ha : IsStarNormal a) : True := by
  let b : A := star a * a
  have : b = cfc (fun x : ℂ ↦ star x * x) a := by
    cfc_pull +zetaDelta ℂ a
  trivial

/- Transitively, through nested definitions. -/
example (ha : IsStarNormal a) : True := by
  let u : A := star a
  let v : A := u * a
  have : v = cfc (fun x : ℂ ↦ star x * x) a := by
    cfc_pull +zetaDelta ℂ a
  trivial

/- The other way in, and the reason the default is what it is: `set` hands you the equation, so
you decide when the abstraction is opened rather than the tactic deciding for you. -/
example (ha : IsStarNormal a) : True := by
  have : star a * a = cfc (fun x : ℂ ↦ star x * x) a := by
    set b := star a * a with hb
    rw [hb]
    cfc_pull ℂ a

/-! ## `cfc_pull` followed by `cfc_congr`

This is the workflow the tactic exists for. `cfc_pull` reduces an identity between two
expressions built from the calculus to an identity between the two functions, and `cfc_congr`
then reduces that to a pointwise statement on the spectrum. Neither of the two functions below is
the one the user wrote down; that is exactly the point. -/

/- `cfc_pull` converts from the non-unital calculus over `ℝ` to the unital one over `ℂ`. It does
not close the goal: it produces `fun x ↦ x + I * ↑√(1 - x.re ^ 2)`, whereas the statement asks
for `fun x ↦ ↑x.re + I * ↑√(1 - x.re ^ 2)`. Both are correct — `a` is selfadjoint, so the two
functions agree on `spectrum ℂ a` — and closing the gap is exactly the job of `cfc_congr`. -/

/-! ## Truncated subtraction over `ℝ≥0`

`cfc_sub` needs a `CommRing`, so over `ℝ≥0` it is rejected by instance synthesis and `cfc_tsub`
takes over. It carries the extra hypothesis `∀ x ∈ spectrum ℝ≥0 a, g x ≤ f x`, which becomes a
`cfc_pull.side` goal. `cfc_tsub` is tagged at a lower priority, so over a ring `cfc_sub` still
wins. -/
