# The `@[cfc_pull]` lemma set

This file tags Mathlib's continuous functional calculus lemmas with `@[cfc_pull]`, building the
database the `cfc_pull` tactic searches. Nothing else happens here: every lemma named below is
proved elsewhere, and the tags are collected in one place rather than written at the declaration
sites so that the tactic and everything supporting it can be read, reviewed and landed as a
self-contained unit.

The categories a lemma can fall into (`Id`, `Pull`, `Scalar`, `Unital`, `Compose`) are described
in `Mathlib/Tactic/CFCPull/Spec.md` §4; the attribute works out which one applies from the shape
of the lemma's statement. §9 of the same document walks through the set below and says why each
group is there. The sections here follow that walkthrough.

Where a lemma is *deliberately* absent, the reason is recorded in a comment next to the group it
would have joined.

/-! ### Identity

The lemmas that say the calculus applied to the identity function is the element itself. -/

attribute [cfc_pull] cfc_id' cfcₙ_id'

/-! ### Unitality

The bridge from the non-unital calculus to the unital one, used whenever a `cfcₙ` shows up in a
goal that asks for a `cfc`. -/

attribute [cfc_pull] cfcₙ_eq_cfc

/-! ### Scalars

Widening (`ℝ≥0 → ℝ → ℂ`) and narrowing (`ℂ → ℝ → ℝ≥0`) conversions. The four narrowing lemmas
carry a hypothesis the tactic cannot read off the syntax, which comes back as a
`cfc_pull.side` goal; they are tagged all the same, so that any two of the three rings are
reachable from one another. -/

/-! ### Sums

`cfc_sum` and `cfcₙ_sum` cannot pull *through* a sum, but they collect one whose summands are
already applications of the calculus, which is the second half of the staged idiom of
`Spec.md` §11. Their algebraic side has a hole under a binder, which the attribute warns about
by default. -/

attribute [cfc_pull] cfc_sum cfcₙ_sum

/-! ### Pulling, at a concrete scalar ring

The operations that are secretly an application of the calculus: positive and negative parts,
square roots, absolute values, powers, logarithms, exponentials, real and imaginary parts, the
spectral construction for a Hermitian matrix, and the `Unitization` bridges.

`cfc_tsub` and `cfcₙ_tsub` sit at priority 900, below the generic `cfc_sub`/`cfcₙ_sub` that win
wherever the scalars form a ring; over `ℝ≥0` those are rejected by instance synthesis and the
truncated versions take over, at the cost of a `cfc_pull.side` goal.

`CFC.real_exp_eq_normedSpace_exp` and `CFC.complex_exp_eq_normedSpace_exp` sit at 1100 so that
`Real.exp`/`Complex.exp` are produced in preference to `NormedSpace.exp`. -/

attribute [cfc_pull 1100] CFC.real_exp_eq_normedSpace_exp CFC.complex_exp_eq_normedSpace_exp

attribute [cfc_pull 900] cfc_tsub cfcₙ_tsub

/- The generic `Unitization.cfcₙ_eq_cfc_inr` is *not* tagged: its `hp` hypothesis relating the
two predicates is not something the tactic can discharge.

`CFC.sqrt_eq_cfc_complex_sqrt` and `CFC.sqrt_eq_cfcₙ_complex_sqrt` are not tagged either, for a
different reason; see the module docstring of
`Mathlib/Analysis/SpecialFunctions/ContinuousFunctionalCalculus/CFCPull/ComplexSqrt.lean`. -/

/-! ### Pulling through a homomorphism

Note that the element to pull towards lives in the *codomain*. -/

attribute [cfc_pull] StarAlgHom.map_cfc NonUnitalStarAlgHom.map_cfcₙ

/- The `...Class` counterparts `StarAlgHomClass.map_cfc` and `NonUnitalStarAlgHomClass.map_cfcₙ`
are **not** tagged: their auxiliary scalar ring `S` occurs only in the instance arguments and so
is undetermined at application time. See `Spec.md` §11. -/

/-! ### Composition -/

  cfc_comp_norm
  cfc_realPart cfc_imaginaryPart cfcₙ_realPart cfcₙ_imaginaryPart

attribute [cfc_pull 1100] cfc_comp_const_mul cfcₙ_comp_const_mul

/- The `ℝ`-valued companions `cfc_comp_re`, `cfc_comp_im`, `cfcₙ_comp_re` and `cfcₙ_comp_im` are
deliberately *not* tagged. They change the scalar ring (`ℝ` on the side with the structured
element `ℜ a`, `ℂ` on the side with the element `a`) *and* the element, and the `@[cfc_pull]`
attribute classifies any lemma whose two sides disagree about the scalar ring as a `Scalar`
conversion, without looking at the elements. Tagging them would therefore add a bogus `ℂ → ℝ`
edge to the conversion graph, along which `cfc_pull` would happily "convert" a result at `a`
into one at `ℜ a`. Supporting them needs a `Compose` category that is allowed to change the
ring; see `Spec.md` §11.

`cfc_apply_pi`, `cfc_map_pi`, `cfc_map_prod` and `cfcₙ_map_prod` are not tagged either. For the
last two there are two independent reasons: the auxiliary scalar ring `S` occurs only in the
hypotheses, so `cfc_pull` cannot determine it when it applies the lemma; and even with `S`
pinned down the two components `cfc f a` and `cfc f b` are not *holes* — a hole must be an
application of the calculus at the element and in the algebra being pulled towards, here
`(a, b)` in `A × B` — so the lemma could only collect a pair that is already of the form
`(cfc f a, cfc f b)`, never build one component by component. See `Spec.md` §11. -/
