# `CFC.sqrt` via the complex functional calculus

`CFC.sqrt` is defined by the non-unital continuous functional calculus over `ℝ≥0`. On a
nonnegative element it agrees with the calculus applied to `Complex.sqrt`, which is what one
wants when the surrounding computation is taking place over `ℂ`.

## Main results

* `Complex.continuousOn_sqrt_setOf_re_nonneg`: `Complex.sqrt` is continuous on the closed right
  half-plane.
* `Complex.continuousOn_sqrt_quasispectrum`, `Complex.continuousOn_sqrt_spectrum`:
  `Complex.sqrt` is continuous on the (quasi)spectrum of a nonnegative element, which is what
  makes the calculus applicable to it in the first place.
* `CFC.sqrt_eq_cfcₙ_complex_sqrt`, `CFC.sqrt_eq_cfc_complex_sqrt`: `CFC.sqrt a = cfcₙ
  Complex.sqrt a` and `CFC.sqrt a = cfc Complex.sqrt a` for `0 ≤ a`.

## Implementation notes

Neither of the last two is tagged `@[cfc_pull]`, unlike its real counterpart
`CFC.sqrt_eq_real_sqrt`. `Complex.sqrt` is continuous only away from the negative reals, so a
`cfc_pull` that met a square root would raise a `ContinuousOn Complex.sqrt ..` goal that it can
discharge only when the element is *known* to be nonnegative — the two lemmas above are what does
it, but they need `0 ≤ a` in hand. Name the lemma where it is wanted instead:

```lean
example (ha : 0 ≤ a) : CFC.sqrt a * CFC.sqrt a = cfc (fun x : ℂ ↦ x.sqrt * x.sqrt) a := by
  cfc_pull [CFC.sqrt_eq_cfc_complex_sqrt] ℂ a
```
